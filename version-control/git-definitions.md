# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
- Version control  is a software/system  that records changes to a file over time so that they can recall specific versions later.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
- A branch is a copy of a project, that you are working on. It is is important to use, because if you want to add new features to your project and working  with multiple people on it, it helps in the way that you can test it and make changes before you can merge those changes to the  final project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
- A commit is a command that is used in git to commit the changes that you have made to a specific file. A good commit message should give a description of the changes that have been made, in order that oder people can understand them.
* What is a merge conflict?
-A merge conflict happens when a two separate people make the same changes, in the same line of code and submit them, so git doesn't know witch is right.
