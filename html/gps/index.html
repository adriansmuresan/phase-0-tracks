<!--The purpose of the semantic tags in HTML5 is to give more structure to a document and they also facilitate a way for computers to understand the structure of a document. I think the <aside> elemnt  and the way each section can have it's own header and footer is the most useful.-->
<!--The order in which elemnts are displayed in a browser is usually top to bottom.-->
<!--You can use Sublime Tools to add asnippet ov your own. Yes I will try and create other snippets down the road as it save a lot of time.-->
<!--I didn't get at first were the content of the snippet goes, but after i saw the example it clear now. I also didn't get how the new Semantic Elements go in Html5. After Googling and finding some other sources I got the hang of it. For me a better understanding of some concepts comes from reserching more and different sources.-->
