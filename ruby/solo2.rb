# 6.4 Solo Challenge: Designing and Implementing a Class

# Design (as opposed to actually building) a class representing anything you like.
# (Please make it something we have at least heard of.)
# Whether you want to build a fire-breathing dragon, a dress, or a soccer ball, we hereby grant you the freedom to implement it.
# No matter what you design, your class must have:
# at least three attributes (using at least two data types) whose values will vary from instance to instance (example: age)
# at least three methods, at least one of which takes an argument
# You're welcome to be creative about these: a dress can have a swish method, a soccer ball can have an inflatedness attribute,
# and ... we hope it's obvious what a fire-breathing dragon can do, but if not, you'll figure it out.

# Class Movies
# Attributes:
