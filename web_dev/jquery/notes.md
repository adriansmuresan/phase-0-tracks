# 9.3 jQuery

## Release 0: Make a Plan

* I like to use and try different sources, because I find that some work better than the others. My plan is to watch a tutorial that I found on youtube by Derek Banas. For the second option I will use the Javascript&JQuery book by Jon Duckett.I will watch the video tutorial for about an hour and then read from the book for the second hour. I will take a small break every 20 minutes or so or when I feel the need.

## Release 1: Study Up

* In the end I found that in this case the book worked better for me because the explanation and the examples are more in depth and were more suited to my understanding. The video was ok but I felt that sometimes he was moving too fast and the explanation was not very concise. Taking brakes is important, at least for me, I found that when I try and do more in one seating sometimes my mind wanders off or I loose concentration.
