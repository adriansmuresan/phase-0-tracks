# Release 1: Research Web Servers

## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux operating system is based on Unix and some of its key design philosophies are:
 * Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
 * Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
 * Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
 * Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system, and customers have  access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.
* Some of the advantages of using a VPS are:
   * The cost of a VPS server is much less than with dedicated servers
   *  VPS plans can be customized to meet your needs so you pay for what you want but you do not need to deal with any features you will never need.
   * VPS hosting plans are easily scalable. You can start off in your virtual environment with the minimum amount of resources you need and then as you grow gradually increase your hosting plan to accommodate your needs
   * You have a lot more control over your virtual server than you do with shared hosting. You will likely have root access and the ability to use scripts that may not be allowed in the shared hosting environment.
   * You have the same technical support as with shared hosting for most issues.
   * You can choose from semi managed hosting where the web host handles some maintenance and fully managed services.

#### Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
 * When you are logged as root, you can do everything -- the system won't ask! Do you want to format this disk? Ok, just one click and it's done, because you're root and you know what you're doing...
